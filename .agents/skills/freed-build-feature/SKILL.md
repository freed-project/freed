# Build Feature

Create a product worktree branch from the latest remote `dev`, implement the feature or fix, verify it, and launch the relevant preview.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the work is product work targeting `dev`.
2. Reject or reroute public marketing work targeting `www`; use `freed-build-www` instead.
3. Fetch the latest remote refs first with `git fetch --all --prune`.
4. Check both `origin/dev` and `origin/main` before branching.
   - Confirm whether local `dev` or `main` are behind their remote counterparts.
   - If `origin/main` contains commits that are not in `origin/dev`, call that out before continuing so the user can decide whether `dev` needs to be refreshed first.
5. Create a new worktree branch from `origin/dev` using `./scripts/worktree-add.sh ../freed-<slug> -b <branch> origin/dev`.
6. Implement the requested change.
7. Verify with focused tests, then broader checks when shared behavior changed.
8. Launch the relevant preview:
   - For PWA work, deploy or run the PWA preview.
   - For desktop work, use the desktop E2E test harness or Tauri preview as appropriate.
9. Open a PR targeting `dev` when the work is ready.

## Scope

Default allowed paths include `packages/`, product docs under `docs/`, release tooling, shared app config, and product CI.

Do not use this skill for `website/` only marketing work, homepage copy, public roadmap presentation, or changelog presentation. Those changes target `www`.
