# FREED Marketing & Messaging

## Brand Identity

**Name:** FREED  
**Domain:** freed.wtf  
**Backronym:** "What They Fear"

> *The platforms built empires on your attention—and you just walked out the door.*

---

## Core Themes

### Mental Sovereignty
You own your mind. No algorithm has the right to manipulate your attention, hijack your emotions, or monetize your psychology. FREED is the declaration that your consciousness is not a product.

### Digital Dignity
Every human deserves to engage with technology on their own terms. Digital dignity means transparency, control, and respect—not dark patterns, infinite scrolls, and engagement optimization.

### Your MIND is not for sale
The attention economy treats your focus as a commodity to be extracted and auctioned. FREED rejects this premise entirely. Your attention belongs to you.

## Future Vision: Complete Sovereignty

FREED is phase one. The complete vision includes **publishing** sovereignty via POSSE integration.

```
YOUR SITE ──POSSE──→ Platforms ──FREED──→ YOUR FEED
```

**The pitch:**
> "Read on your terms. Write on your terms. Own everything in between."

> "Your content lives on YOUR domain first. Platforms get copies. If they ban you, your work survives."

This aligns FREED with the broader IndieWeb movement—decentralized, user-owned, platform-agnostic.
